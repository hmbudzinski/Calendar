# Calendar
## What: 
  The objective was to create a day planner that stores the user input in the local storage so when the page is refreshed the information still stays. The page is also meant to track the current time of day and inform the user of what is past, present, and future on their planner

## Why:
    this activity utilized local storage and moment.js

## How:
    I first created the basic layout using columns and rows from bootstrap, once i got those working, i began to work on only one row until i was able to get the local storage working how i needed it. i then duplicated the functions for that row to the other rows 

## Features:
    My page is able to record the user input and store it in local storage and also display it on the main page. It also is able to read the current time and let the user know if the block is in the past, present, or future.

## Difficulties:
    The hardest part of this assignment was getting the time blocks to set correctly and to be responsive to the current time, but with Guidance from Natalia I was able to complete it.
